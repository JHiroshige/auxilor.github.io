## What sets EcoArmor apart from other custom armor plugins?

Most importantly, EcoArmor isn't built for the sole purpose of PvP. Of course, you can use EcoArmor on a PvP-centric server, it will work perfectly - however it has a more generalized featureset. Perfect for Survival, MMORPG, Skyblock, Towny - anything you want, EcoArmor will work perfectly for. Empower your armor sets with better effects for all situations, make sets only work under certain conditions - bring a whole metagame to your armor.
You can apply stat trackers by holding an item and running /stattrackers, and then dropping as many trackers as you want into the GUI!
